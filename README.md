# Database_Backup_App
using this java application we backup our database. used Multithreading and JDBC.


We all know that how important is the database for us. So we must take backup of our databases regularly. 
To make this job easy, I have created an application that will help to create the backup of a given database with a single click.

Best part:- Create a Cyberspace Animated welcome Screen.

Steps:----

Enter the hostname, user id, and password.
Click on check connection button. Once the connection is established successfully then a green tick mark will be shown next to it.
The DB LIST drop down menu will automatically get populated based on the available databases.
Select the database name that you want to back up. Enter the path where you want to save the output result.
Click on backup data button.
